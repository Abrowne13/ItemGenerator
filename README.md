# ItemGenerator
Swift app with Core Data to track items for my game


Purpose: Demonstrate Ability to make an app in Swift. It is a persistant storage for keeping track of item names, stats, id, and flavor text for use in the game I am in ongoing development for. 
An Item is a NSManagedObject and the items can added, edited and deleted.

The app currently has: 
an Item list view that can be used to search for a specific item, 
an Item add/edit view, 
an Item detail view
